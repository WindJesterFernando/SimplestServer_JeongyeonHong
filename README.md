# SimplestServer_JeongyeonHong

Please Read this file before starting the project!

1. Build Server and Client project.
2. Open Server.exe first!
3. Open 3 Client.exe! // 2 for players and 1 for observer.
4. Please type ID and Password then submit for all players. If you are trying to create observer, please check "Observer".
5. Observer cannot join chat room.
6. If you already joined chat room, then you cannot join Tic-Tac-Toe room right away. Please close players client not observer, then open 2 clients again and try to log in and join Tic-Tac-Toe room. This is a bug.
7. Tic-Tac-Toe room must join 3 players (2players and 1 observer).
